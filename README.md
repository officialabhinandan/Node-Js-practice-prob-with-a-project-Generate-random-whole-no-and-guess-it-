In this repository I've practiced some array based problems on node js learnt from Code with harry youtube channel The Ultimate Javascript playlist(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ahR1blWXxgSlL4y9iQBnLpR).
I've also solved Code with Harry's exercise 1 which is basically Generating a random no in JS and guess that no untill find it and calculate the final score asper the number of trial (video no 22).
